Assumptions Made while Designing the E-Commerce Deal
1. I have certain set of Customers already available.
2. I will only use db to store the information regarding the Deal - create, update, fetch, delete etc.
3. I am assuming the endTime is given as a DateTime and during the update as well we will do the same.
4. The Id for the deal creation would always be created by the controller.
